GNOME extension that improves the _Activities Overview_:
- removes the desktop (wallpaper)
- hides dash and panel
- blacklist for excluding certain applications from the overview
- pre-selects a window so that keyboard navigation is possible right away
	- default: window that currently has focus
	- fallback: previously active window
- replaces scaling animation (on hover / focus) with a simple outline
- captions are visible all the time
- slightly faster animations
